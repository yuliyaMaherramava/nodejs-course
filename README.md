# Task 1: Voting System

Develop a voting system with backend services to provide answer options, accept votes, and return vote statistics. The frontend should display options as buttons, show current statistics, and update them after each vote.

# Task 2: Server-side Validation Form

Simple form with server-side validation that uses EJS to render HTML from the server. Upon successful validation, the server will display the submitted data. If validation fails, an error message will be shown, and the form will be re-displayed with the previously entered data.

# Task 3: Content-Type & Accept Headers

Develop a service to retrieve voting results from Task 1, returning the results in XML, HTML, or JSON format based on the `Accept` request header. Ensure the response includes the appropriate `Content-Type` headers for each format. Additionally, add buttons below the voting block to allow users to download the voting results in all three formats.
